                <h4>Q: Is counseling really confidential?</h4>
                <p>
                    Yes, absolutely. Everything you share in counseling sessions remains completely 
                    confidential. We only break confidentiality in cases where there is risk of harm 
                    to yourself or others, as required by professional ethics.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h4>Q: Do I have to have a "serious problem" to seek help?</h4>
                <p>
                    Not at all. You don't need to be in crisis to benefit from counseling. Many students 
                    seek support for everyday stress, life transitions, or simply to talk through their 
                    feelings. Early support can prevent small concerns from becoming bigger issues.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h4>Q: What if I'm too busy to attend sessions?</h4>
                <p>
                    We understand students have busy schedules. We offer flexible appointment times, 
                    including evenings and weekends when possible. Even one session can provide helpful 
                    tools and strategies. Your mental health is worth prioritizing.

                <h4>Q: Will this affect my academic record or applications?</h4>
                <p>
                    No. Seeking mental health support is completely separate from your academic record. 
                    Universities and employers do not have access to counseling information. Taking care 
                    of your mental health shows maturity and self-awareness.

                <p>
                    For urgent situations outside our hours, please contact local emergency services 
                    or crisis hotlines. We can provide you with a list of 24/7 mental health resources.
